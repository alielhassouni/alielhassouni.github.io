# Abstract.
abstract = "Research has shown that personalization of health interventions can contribute to an improved effectiveness. Reinforcement learning algorithms can be used to perform such tailoring. In this paper, we present a cluster-based reinforcement learning approach which learns optimal policies for groups of users. Such an approach can speed up the learning process while still giving a level of personalization. We apply both online and batch learning to learn policies over the clusters and introduce a publicly available simulator which we have developed to evaluate the approach. The results show batch learning signifcantly outperforms online learning. Furthermore, near-optimal clustering is found which proves to be beneficial in learning signifcantly better policies compared to learning per user and learning across all users."
